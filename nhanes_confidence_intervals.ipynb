We will also cover some important points relating to the properties of confidence intervals, and discuss how to use and interpret confidence intervals in practice.  We will use the 2015-2016 wave of the [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) data for all the analyses below.\n",

    "It is important to note that the NHANES data are a \"complex survey\".  The data are not an independent and representative sample from the target population.  Proper analysis of complex survey data should make use of additional information about the manner in which the data were collected.  Since complex survey analysis is a somewhat specialized topic, we ignore this aspect of the data here, and analyze the NHANES data as if it were an independent and identically distributed sample from a population.\n",

    "In this section, we demonstrate the construction of confidence intervals for the proportion of people who smoke.  The specific definition of \"smoker\" used here ([SMQ020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/SMQ_I.htm#SMQ020)) identifies a person as being a smoker if they self-report as having smoked 100 or more cigarettes in their lifetime.  It is more accurate to refer to this as a measure of \"lifetime smoking\" rather than \"current smoking\".  Recall that the definitions of these and other NHANES variables can be found using the NHANES code books, or by searching using the link below.\n",

This suggests that there is a substantial difference between the lifetime smoking rates for women and men. However there is no explicit information here about how different the two population proportions might be.  To address this question, we can form a confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of females who smoke and the proportion of males who smoke.  \n",

This difference of around 20 percentage points is only a point estimate of the underlying true value -- it is not exactly equal to the difference between the unknown proportions of females and males who smoke in the population.  A confidence interval helps us assess how far the estimated difference may be from the true difference.\n",

    "As above, we start with the standard error.  The difference between two sample proportions based on independent data has a standard error that reflects the combined uncertainty in the two proportions being differenced.  This standard error can be calculated very easily.  If SE1 and SE2 are the standard errors for two proportions, then sqrt(SE1^2 + SE2^2) is the standard error for the difference of these proportions (`sqrt` is the square root function).  Note that this formula is only accurate if the two sample proportions being differenced are independent.\n",

Based on this plot, we see that in the United States, smoking is more common in men than in women, not just overall, but also in every one of the age bands.  The difference is largest for older people -- for people older than 60, the smoking rate for males is around 30 percentage points greater than the smoking rate for females, while for people younger than 30, the smoking rate for males is only around 15 percentage points greater than the smoking rate for females.\n",

    "## Confidence intervals for the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we discuss how to construct confidence intervals for the mean.  First note that the proportion discussed above is also a mean -- for example, if the data are 0, 1, 0, then the mean is 1/3, which is also the proportion of 1's in the data.  However the proportion has the special property that the variance is completely determined by the mean. That is why we constructed the standard errors for the sample proportion above using p•(1 - p) as the variance.  In general, the variance of quantitative data will not be a function of the mean, as this is a very special property of binary data.  Therefore, in general we must estimate the variance as a separate step after estimating the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the construction of confidence intervals for the population mean of a quantitative variable, we will use the body mass inde (BMI) data from NHANES.  To begin, we calculate the mean BMI for all women and for all men in the NHANES sample."

    "Now we turn to studying the difference between two means, taking the difference between mean female and male BMI for illustration.  As discussed above, the standard error for the difference of two means taken from independent samples is sqrt(SE1^2 + SE2^2), where SE1 and SE2 are the standard errors for the two means being compared.  Below we see that this gives us a value around 0.19 when comparing the female BMI to the male BMI.  This is substantially larger than either the SEM for estimating the female mean (0.14) or the SEM for estimating the male mean (0.12).  It is expected that the standard error for the difference between two means is greater than the standard errors for estimating a single mean, since the uncertainty of both gender-specific proportions impacts the statistic."

Informally, we can say that the data strongly suggest that the female mean BMI is greater than the male mean BMI in this age band, with the difference being anywhere from 0.5 to 2 units."

    "**Inter-group and intra-group differences:** As the sample size grows, estimates become increasingly precise, but it is important to remember that a highly precise estimate for the mean does not imply that individuals within a population do not vary from each other.  To put the differences shown above in context, below we show the underlying summaries on which the plot above was based.  Note that the standard deviation of BMI within both females and males ranges from around 5 to around 8 depending on the age band.  This means, for example, that two randomly-selected males will tend to have BMI values that differ by around 6 units.  This is a far greater difference than the mean difference of up to around 1.5 BMI units between females and males.  Thus, while there is a tendency for females to have slightly higher BMI than males, the heterogeneity within genders is substantially greater than the difference of means between genders."

    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals reflect the precision of an estimate, which is largely driven by the amount of data used to construct the estimate.  We can explore the relationship between precision and sample size by subampling data from NHANES and calculating confidence intervals for the subsamples.  Below we calculate confidence intervals based on subsamples of size 100, 200, 400, and 800.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wider confidence interval implies that we have less precision in our estimate.  In the simulation below, we calculate the average width of the confidence intervals constructed for each sample size.  We see that the confidence interval steadily becomes shorter as the sample size grows.  For most settings, the confidence interval will become around half as wide when the sample size is increased by a factor of 4.  Below we see this scaling when the sample size increases from 100 to 400, and when it increases from 200 to 800, both of which are increases by a factor of 4."

We calculate each of these below.  The sum of these two probabilities should be around 0.05, which is the allowed proportion of the time that a 95% confidence interval does not cover its target."
